## Description 📖

Markdown is awesome! All your README.md are made in Markdown, but do you know how GitHub are rendering them?

It’s time to code a Markdown to HTML!

## Requirements

- 🚩 All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7 or higher)
- 🚩The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- 🚩A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- 🚩Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.\*)
- 🚩All your files must be executable
- 🚩All your modules should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- 🚩Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
